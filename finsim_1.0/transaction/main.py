#main.py starts everything up for the transaction server of FinSim
#main.py has two classes - Config and startSim
#Instructions on properly running main.py can be found at the end of the program

#Config class reads in the config file to set up the server, merchants, and card companies for the transaction server.
#3 functions and init: __init__(self, file), create_config(self), getConfig(self, buffer, start, finish), and getNestedConfig(self, buffer, start, finish)
class Config:
    #init simply sets the class's file variable to the filename specified in the supplied parameter "file"
	def __init__ (self, file):

					"merchant" : self.getNestedConfig(buffer, buffer.index("Merchant:") + 1, buffer.index("Card_Companies:")),  #getNestedConfig function to parse through merchant information listed
					"card_co" : self.getNestedConfig(buffer, buffer.index("Card_Companies:") + 1, len(buffer))}     #getNestedConfig function to parse through the card company information listed

			print "Merchant: "
			print "Card_Companies: "

			sys.exit()  #and exit the program because the user incorrectly wrote up the config file

    #getConfig(self, buffer, start, finish) parses through the buffer from the index 'start' until 'finish' and adds them to a config dictionary for easy access later on
    #   The function returns the populated config dictionary after reaching 'finish'
    #   The config dictionary is set up so that the keys - how the dictionary is indexed - is the data field names, and the value is the data value (or values if there were multiple data values)
	def getConfig(self, buffer, start, finish):

				config[i[0][:-1]] = i[1]    #only store the second substring - key being the name of the data field, and value being the data value
		return config   #return the config

    #getNestedConfig(self, buffer, start, finish) is virtually the same as getConfig but it instead parses a buffer of multiple sub-entries rather than one
    #   The function returns a dictionary of dictionaries, where each sub-dictionary is for each sub-entry in the buffer

			elif len(i) == 2 and name != "":    #otherwise, there are 2 substrings on the current line and the name (the first line) has been taken care of already
