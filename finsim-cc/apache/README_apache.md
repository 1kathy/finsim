# Documentation for Apache with Flask for finsim-cc

- Consult the /src readme to make sure you have the right libraries downloaded, using venv
- Checklist of things to potentially change in apache config file:
    - Ensure that WSGIDaemonProcess user=finsim matches a user that exists on your system (same for ServerAdmin entry)
    - Ensure that the path of your WSGI file matches the path found here
    - Ensure that the path to the Flask app code matches what you use for the Directory section

- Enable the app for finsim_cc to be deployed on the Apache server by running
    - `sudo a2ensite finsim_cc`

- Start Apache server by running
    - `sudo systemctl enable apache2`
    - `sudo systemctl start apache2`

- Consult the documentation for the WSGI file to ensure that it works correctly
- Consider adjusting the logging level in `finsim_cc.conf` when debugging the apache server

# Steps to use self-signed ssl cert
- `openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out <name>.crt -keyout <name>.key`
    - It is primarily important that for the FQDN you enter the url/ip address you are using for finsim-cc
    - Enter input for each description field or "."
- Enable ssl for apache2
    - `a2enmod ssl`
    - Then restart apache
- Make sure all uses of the Python requests library specifies `verify=False` as one of the parameters if using a self-signed ssl cert
    - i.e. `requests.post(..., verify=False)`
- If you do use this for an actual production environment, use a public CA rather than self-signed certs!
    - Also make sure that all uses of Python requests library does **NOT** use `verify=False`
- Make sure the paths listed for the certificate and key files are correct
- For apache finsim_trans config file
    - Edit VirtualHost port to 443, not 80
    - ```SSLEngine on```
    - ```SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/crt/cc.crt```
    - `SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/crt/cc.key`
